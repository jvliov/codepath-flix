### Notes
When I first started the project, I did not notice that I had selected a project for all of Apple's devices. I got pretty far into the assignment and even made my own LaunchScreen.storyboard file because I couldn't find my own. I went back and watched from the beginning and realized what my I did wrong. Then I simply selected the right project type (iOS app) and finished the assignment.
